Script/Editor changelog


Please take care  : 
* It is a good practice to clear all the Ckeditor directory before installing a new major version into Pi (lib files may vary)
* It is advised to clear the /plugins dir before installing a new distro (official plugin list & code may vary).

Pi CKEditor plugins
Those are added upon standard package
Currently we chose >>> colordialog, iframe, showblocks

How to build PI CKEditor Package?
The Pi CKEditor package has to be made through CKEditor Builder http://ckeditor.com/builder

What options to select in the CKEditor Builder page?
Choose standard package + all languages + add the above additional "Pi CKEditor plugins"

Personalize the Format Selector values - H1,H2,H3, etc - to fit your theme css
see http://ckeditor.com/addon/format

How to add a new plugin ?
Go to the plugin area of CKEditor website
Each time you want to add a new plugin, you have to build a new package of CKEditor from their website, to activate your new plugin.
Otherwise, if you copied the new plugin from full package, you have to activate it in config.js (config.extraPlugins value - see CKEditor docs) to make it work.

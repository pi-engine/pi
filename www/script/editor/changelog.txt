Please take care  : 
* It is a good practice to clear all the Ckeditor directory before installing a new major version into Pi (lib files may vary)
* It is advised to clear the /plugins dir before installing a new distro (official plugin list & code may vary).

Pi CKEditor plugins
Those are added upon standard package
Currently we are monitoring >>> Colordialog, Iframe(iframe), Showblocks, Enhanced Image, Media Embed and Semantic Media Embed

How to build PI CKEditor Package?
The Pi CKEditor package has to be made through CKEditor Builder http://ckeditor.com/builder
Easiest way : select the right options in the web page (see below)
Alternative way : use the build-config.js file from actual Pi CKEditor directory
Dont't forget to keep index.hmtl files (history-1) for sec reason
Don't upload /samples and /adapters directories

What options to select in the CKEditor Builder page?
Choose standard package + all languages + add the above additional "Pi CKEditor plugins"

Personalize the Format Selector values - H1,H2,H3, etc - to fit your theme css
see http://ckeditor.com/addon/format

How to add a new plugin ?
Go to the plugin area of CKEditor website
Each time you want to add a new plugin, you have to build a new package of CKEditor from their website, to activate your new plugin.
Alternatively you can copy/paste the new plugin from full package, but you have to activate it in config.js (config.extraPlugins value - see CKEditor docs) to make it work.

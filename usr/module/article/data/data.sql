The specification was extended with local edits, creases, and other features, and formalized into a usable technique for animation in 1998 at Pixar. Until recently the technology had not enjoyed widespread adoption in animation. This is about to change. Pixar has now decided to release its subdivision patents and working codebase in the hope that giving away its high-performance GPU-accelerated code will create a standard for geometry throughout the animation industry.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<h3 style="margin: 2em 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 1; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n		<span style="line-height: 1;">Is Subdivision new?</span></h3>\r\n	<div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n			People have built high polygon models for years, but the same results can be achieved now with a much lower poly count with OpenSubdiv. Subdivision surfaces generally provide great advantages such as arbitrary topology and fantastic control. You can put the points where you need them and one does not need to add extra points &ndash; one just models naturally. Many people switched to some form of subdivision in around 2005-2006 when Maya first offered subdivision. Prior to Maya&rsquo;s adoption, studios with RenderMan would simply model in poly cages and pass those to RenderMan for subdivision. In 2005 Maya began offering an accurate CPU based &ldquo;preview&rdquo; which artists found invaluable.&nbsp;But the definition of subdivision varies greatly and it is hard to move a model from package to package or renderer to renderer and have them load and look the same. If the industry is fairly agreed that subdivision is a good idea &ndash; and even the geometry primitive of the future &ndash; then, as Pixar TD Manuel Kraemer points out, &ldquo;we should at least agree on what the definition of a subdivision surface -&nbsp;Catmull-Clark or whatever &ndash; we should agree on what it&nbsp;<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">really</em>&nbsp;is and the devil&nbsp;<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">is</em>&nbsp;in the detail!&rdquo;</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n			OpenSubdiv&nbsp;is a consistent implementation of subdivision, with GPU and CPU versions, and one that promises greater interoperability and interchange &ndash; in short, it offers a professional standard. The resulting output from an&nbsp;OpenSubdiv pipeline is streamlined but it also means that models will look the same and have the same controls, weights and look in a variety of packages, something not true before OpenSubdiv.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n			OpenSubdiv offers features like creases (edge sharpness), limit surface evaluation, hierarchical edits. Plus it offers modeling speed and memory reduction (very important with sculpting), and it offers interoperability.</p>\r\n		<h5 style="margin: 1.5em 0px 7px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 16px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n			An example in practice</h5>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n			Both Maya&rsquo;s animation interface and Pixar&rsquo;s proprietary Presto animation system can take up to 100ms to subdivide a character of 30,000 polygons to the second level of subdivision (500,000 polygons).&nbsp;<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">But</em>&nbsp;doing the same thing with OpenSubdiv&rsquo;s GPU codepath&nbsp;takes 3ms and allows the user to see the smooth, accurate limit surface&nbsp;at all times. The aim of&nbsp;OpenSubdiv is to allow the artist to work with a more faithful representation of what you are doing. It can render faster, and allow for greater interoperability. But this is not a plugin.&nbsp;You cannot simply run your existing high poly count models through OpenSubdiv to make them faster. Rather, you need to think about modeling at much lower resolution and let the subdivision process &ndash; managed by OpenSubdiv &ndash; provide the high quality, high poly count surface at render time.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n			There are some key aspects to the&nbsp;OpenSubdiv project, including some really interesting new opportunities:</p>\r\n		<ol style="margin: 0px 1.5em 1.5em 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 1.5em; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n			<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n				Simplicity with&nbsp;edges/creases</li>\r\n			<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n				Efficiency with textures</li>\r\n			<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n				GPU implementation</li>\r\n			<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n				Hierarchical modeling</li>\r\n		</ol>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n			But before looking at those current issues it is worth looking at some of the background of OpenSubdiv.</p>\r\n	</div>\r\n	<h3 style="margin: 2em 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 1; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n		<a name="Heritage" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); cursor: pointer; outline: none;"></a>Heritage and background</h3>\r\n	<div class="pullquote right" style="margin: 0px; padding: 20px 0px 20px 30px; border: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; width: 307.34375px; text-align: center; line-height: 26px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); float: right; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n			&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very excited&hellip;It&rsquo;s nice to have a standard implementation that&rsquo;s going to produce the same results in all&nbsp;software.

Pixar has heavily promoted&nbsp;OpenSubdiv in an effort to one day have a powerful interchange format that both works very quickly on the GPU and very reliably on the CPU. While subdiv did exist outside the work Pixar was using internally, most implementations were based on papers and research done by staff at Pixar. And ever since Pixar moved to allow their research to be in the open source community many other companies have started to come on board. The team at Luxology licensed the core technology before there was even a formal &lsquo;OpenSubdiv program&rsquo;.</p>\r\n	<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n		Autodesk has aggressively supported Pixar both for their internal tools and now in Maya so that soon everyone can benefit. Side Effects Software is coming on board with Houdini and now even realtime applications are appearing. Remarkably it is only a year since&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fxguide.com/featured/pixars-encouraging-performance-by-giving-away-the-good-stuff/" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; outline: none;">Pixar announced their decision</a>&nbsp;to put subdiv into the open source community. The idea came from a pitch that Manuel Kraemer made to Bill Polson, Pixar&rsquo;s&nbsp;Director of Industry Strategy. As Polson recalls it, pretty much everything that Kraemer pitched in that meeting has come to fruition today. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think enough credit can go to&nbsp;Manuel Kraemer,&rdquo; Polson says. &ldquo;A few years ago he came into my office and said, &lsquo;Bill, I think we need to do some real work with subdivision and try and get it to be an industry standard. He kind of laid it all out on my whiteboard &ndash; I wish I&rsquo;d taken a picture of that whiteboard!&rdquo;.</p>\r\n	<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n		The concern Pixar&rsquo;s internal team had was that it just made too much sense to not have a standard, but as Pixar owned many of the key patents and the keys to RenderMan, it would be hard for anyone else to do as good a job, or deal with some of the complexity like facevarying, hierarchy or the important &lsquo;creasing&rsquo;. This meant that a less than optimal version could, de facto, become a standard if Pixar kept quiet and withheld support of their technology and patents. Pixar would then be faced with having a standard that was inferior to their internal model and all hopes of interoperability would be lost. Furthermore, for subdiv to work well Pixar wanted a great GPU implementation and any graphics card company would, for the same reasons, end up not supporting the possibly &lsquo;secret&rsquo; superior Pixar version. By Pixar adopting the open source model it stands a great chance of companies like Autodesk, The Foundry, &nbsp;Smith Micro Software (Poser)&nbsp;<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">and</em>&nbsp;Nvidia completely and faithfully supporting the Pixar model, and that benefits everyone.</p>\r\n	<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n		In giving their subdiv away Pixar would get back both industry adoption (and thus hardware support) and Pixar artists &ndash; and artists worldwide &ndash; could work more effectively. Pixar has actually done comprehensive studies on artists animating with IK rigs etc that show not only is responsiveness cost effective, but as systems pass certain responsiveness thresholds (50 ~ 60 frames per second in terms of interactive refresh times) artists grip their pens or mice less firmly, relaxing arm and wrist muscles and thus reducing strain injuries. By making their artists able to enjoy faster responsiveness, Pixar saves production time &ndash; and more importantly their artists are healthier.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'html', 'upload/article/feature/2013/09/26/5243d0bf0e31b.jpg', 1, 0, 'Pi', 1, 11, 11, 1, 1380175744, 1380176121, 1380176815, 1);

In fact the name is really just a code name for a group of technologies.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	That being said, what was shown was incredibly interesting. &ldquo;Architecturally the system is independent of Maya &ndash; it&rsquo;s stand alone. Speaking technically&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st itself doesn&rsquo;t know that Maya exists, it is completely stand alone,&rdquo; Marcus Nordenstam told fxguide. Nordenstam was the co-founder Naiad and is now at Autodesk. &ldquo;Obviously an artist needs an environment to edit the graphs or nodes, and look at the preview of the result, and of course light and render, so we have picked Maya as the first environment to do that in as we know Maya will definitely be one of the environments people would want to use it in. But in the near future you would be able to export the graph you make in Maya and compute it independently in very much the way one might do with a Naiad Graph, and then solve it on the command line. We want to be able to export a sim and run it off the command line, but it opens it up to being finished perhaps on the &lsquo;cloud&rsquo;, say.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Interestingly, in this respect&nbsp;Project Bifr&ouml;st is an engine in much the same way as the recently released Houdini Engine. And again Houdini Engine can run inside Maya, but is not limited to Maya. &ldquo;It is interesting,&rdquo; says Nordenstam, &ldquo;Naiad was sort of a engine &ndash; like Houdini Engine &ndash; and&nbsp;Project Bifr&ouml;st very much is an engine, so&nbsp;we have been building an engine and what we are asking ourselves now is which applications to put this engine into. It&rsquo;s really exciting actually.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	As a cloud implementation is very possible, this opens the door to exploring even a mobile implementation. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the power of what we are doing, we are decoupling authoring environments from compute,&rdquo; says Nordenstam. &ldquo;They could be the same, but in theory you could imagine an iPad app where you use your finger to move (Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st) nodes around, but the actual compute is in the cloud. We are certainly not announcing that, but this is what the architecture could allow.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Just as Naiad before it, the code for Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st is written for multi-threading but it is being built in a more distributed, multi-machine approach than Naiad ever was. For example, on Naiad you could not run a single fluid simulation on more than one machine, on Project Bifr&ouml;st you can. Even with the multi-threading the actual simulation had to be on one machine. A multiple machine solution working on one graph would make the Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st implementation suitable for say running on the Intel Xeon Phi. But Autodesk is exploring all implementations including GPU implementations.</p>\r\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="margin: 0px auto 20px; padding: 4px; border: none; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif;

What is new is how the graph is evaluated. Other node-based software (including Naiad) present the graph to be evaluated in the form of a graph, making graph traversal itself a key part of the evaluation. The computer needs to traverse thousands of nodes to compute the solution. Each node may be simple, and often they are, but surprisingly the time taken traversing the data structures is significant.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	In the real world, projects produce very complex graphs and so&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st tries to directly address this for the first time. The team has decoupled the user&rsquo;s UI representation from the computer&rsquo;s data graph representation. This means there is an internal system that compiles the user&rsquo;s graph on the fly into more efficient machine code, and of course all the computer worries about is the output of this. In effect it compiles the graphical nodes into hard coded C++ code on the fly thus dramatically improving performance. Nordenstam suggests that this hard coded code that gets complied and runs is like having an artist working on a shot in the node based view and having &ldquo;your best friend sitting beside you who says &lsquo;write me your best C++ program that does exactly what my graph does&rsquo; &ndash; and then that run that for me!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Critically, this real time compile does not have to just traverse the tree, &ldquo;it does this magic analysis of your graph and generates the code from the tree in a non-graph form.&rdquo; To use an example to illustrate this, imagine you have to create four nodes:</p>\r\n<ol style="margin: 0px 1.5em 1.5em 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 1.5em; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n		<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.5;">create&nbsp;</span>fluid<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;and then</span></li>\r\n	<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n		<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.5;">add gravity&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n	<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n		<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.5;">do collisions</span></li>\r\n	<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n		<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.5;">cache to disc</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	In&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st it would not run the first node, then run the second etc. Instead it would look at everything and then it would explode all those nodes to the lowest level sub-networks, exposing all the sub-nets and having a huge real nodal tree. Then, knowing what all these subnets do (including loops), it produces efficient machine code, and then runs that rather than a series of steps one after another as mirrored directly in the higher level UI.&nbsp;This is much more than an old-school Shake trick of concatenating like-type nodes. This in no way stops one from viewing the process at any stage in the graph, as&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st recompiles instantly, but just to that point in the graph, by doing a partial nodal tree compile.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	The interesting thing is, if Autodesk decides it wants to support a GPU version, then&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st would just compile GPU code instead. It is a very elegant solution for a multi-targeted product code base. &ldquo;Not only that,&rdquo; suggests&nbsp;Nordenstam, &ldquo;we could say &lsquo;Hey, let&rsquo;s generate Xbox code, let&rsquo;s generate Playstation 4 code, for example. This can go quite far. It is the next generation graphing type technology. I think you are going to see a lot more people doing this sort of thing in the future, and we are one of the first.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="margin: 0px auto 20px; padding: 4px;

In a program like Maya one would be hard pushed to view it, it would either not fit in GPU RAM or it would cause large amounts of swapping. From an artist&rsquo;s point of view the user experience would be poor. Autodesk is very keen to make any implementation very interactive, so the team has developed a paging system that pages in low res for distant smoke and only high res in the close up. This is just a viewing tool but the same approach can be found in the simulation side. &ldquo;That is the other big exciting thing in&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st &ndash; this&nbsp;<b>adaptive data structure</b>&nbsp;that we are doing,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Nordenstam.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	<a class="fx_colorbox cboxElement alignright" href="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/voxels.jpg" style="margin: 4px 0px 0px 24px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; outline: none; display: inline-block; float: right; position: relative;"><img alt="voxels" class="alignright  wp-image-46399" height="183" src="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/voxels-320x230.jpg" style="margin: 4px 0px 12px 24px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; display: inline; float: right;" width="253" /></a>The adaptive data structure was shown indirectly at the Autodesk Users Group in Anaheim. &ldquo;We are able to represent a single fluid now finally &ndash; adaptively,&rdquo; adds Nordenstam. &ldquo;This area for example is higher resolution than that, so we can have a single fluid that actually is fundamentally represented at a higher level on the surface where you want the detail than say at the bottom. And no one else is doing this that I am aware in the commercial space.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	The distributed nature of Bifrost combined with the heavy use of adaptivity led to the development of a native Bifrost voxel structure as opposed to simply using OpenVDB.&nbsp; However, OpenVDB may still be supported as a one of the voxel file-formats.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	In a sense Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st is a visual programming environment. Through the clever use of sub-nets and compounding the team still presents a very simple high level workflow to an artist. But don&rsquo;t worry if you are a hard core TD, you can still open it up and get in under the hood for some really complex custom solutions.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	<a class="fx_colorbox cboxElement alignleft" href="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/smoke.jpg" style="margin: 4px 24px 0px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; outline: none; display: inline-block; float: left; position: relative;"><img alt="smoke" class="alignleft  wp-image-46400" height="217" src="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/smoke-320x256.jpg" style="margin: 4px 24px 12px 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; display: inline; float: left;" width="271" /></a></p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Is it just for fluid sims and gas sims? Or is Bifr&ouml;st&nbsp;tech applicable to other simulations? The question is hard to really answer today, but certainly one gets the impression the team has a very long term view. Even before the resources and support of Autodesk came to bear, the former Naiad team wanted to extend their work to rigid body simulations, particles, elastic equations and soft bodies. And&nbsp;Nordenstam feels it is &ldquo;even more realistic to do that now because we are at Autodesk and they have more resources and great people, so I have even more faith we can succeed.&rdquo; An example would be deforming geometry based on rules or procedurally in the same way fluids are created.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Naiad is in the DNA of Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st but the code is all new and it benefits from the experience of the ICE Softimage programmers who joined the ex-Naiad team. It is not just Naiad 2, it is a visual programming environment for fluids that learns from both the graphical approach of Naiad and the power of ICE. An example of this is how the ICE team helped allow the Naiad graph nodes be grouped into super nodes &ndash; something not possible in the old Naiad. Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st has both complex new nodes and the ability to enter nodes and modify them. To write your own nodes in Naiad you had to write your own C++ nodes, with&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st most of the nodes will be more like ICE nodes internally, and you will be able to adjust them, study them and tweak them without having to write any code.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Away from the technical underpinnings, most artists need tools to say selectively accentuate peaks or for sharpening features, removing holes or smoothing areas. These &lsquo;crafting&rsquo; steps are what one needs in production &ndash; after all, fluid sims in production are art directed and modified based on the director&rsquo;s vision and the needs of the story. Here Nordenstam decides to quote and reference Bruce Lee of all people. The analogy is based on Lee&rsquo;s use of multiple martial techniques to win a bout. &ldquo;One style does not win the fight,&rdquo; quotes Nordenstam. &ldquo;I have taken the same view with the&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st design. Proceduralism is a very powerful thing but it is not the only style that can win, and I think if you only use it you will loose, and so my opinion is that interactive workflows &ndash; like Maya has traditionally excelled at &ndash; things like interactive modeling and interactive animation &ndash; that is all very powerful. A lot of the tasks such as fixing holes etc lend themselves to the interactive workflow in the viewport. So we don&rsquo;t want to force proceduralism&nbsp;onto a user. The trick is to always keep an eye on whenever we try and make a workflow or a task for an artist in the practical world of day to day, we need to ask is this something you want to do in the viewport with a mouse or is this something that you can control with a parameter, is it interactive or procedural?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	At the end of the day, image quality will define the success of the project. For example, does the new&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st handle very thin sheets of water (which can be an issue with fluids &lsquo;spider webbing&rsquo;)? &ldquo;First,&rdquo; says Nordenstam, &ldquo;I would claim that you could do some of that stuff already with Naiad. I would certainly expect that with the same people behind Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st you will have a lot of the same power and flexibility and a lot of that should be working right out of the box. It should be in pretty good shape.&rdquo; With reference to the specific problem of thin sheets of water and the surface tension acting upon them, Nordenstam&nbsp;agreed that recent research with explicit mesh based patches in this area is exciting, which is very close to finite element analysis, (and further away from a fluid sim FLIP approach).</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Autodesk is actively exploring some hybrid solutions, and&nbsp;Nordenstam says, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be too surprised if in the future if all of a sudden we introduced some mesh based solution. But a lot of people are working on this and who knows if we will be the first ones!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Certainly, image quality is central to the research and key to the success of Naiad when it was launched.&nbsp;Nordenstam: &ldquo;I personally think that one of the key things about Naiad was that there were a lot of things we did not try and do with Naiad, all the things like dynamics. But I really think we did kick the crap out of numerical methods that were stable, and did produce a renderable mesh that did look like liquid and not rice pudding! That was something we really worked hard on.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Users should expect that level of image quality from Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st as it is based on the same meshing algorithm as Naiad, slightly improved but similar. The team remain obsessed with great high end quality for major visual effects, and beyond. It is worth remembering that in the Naiad days the guys could only produce particles or meshes or voxels &ndash; they had no influence or say in rendering. The company was new and small. Neither of those statements are true of Autodesk. &ldquo;With Autodesk we have a set of really powerful renderers that we have a really close relationship with, including V-Ray, Mental Ray, Arnold and RenderMan,&rdquo; outlines Nordenstam. &ldquo;In time, I expect the quality from Bifr&ouml;st -&nbsp;with time &ndash; will greatly exceed anything Naiad could do.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	This project is aiming to seriously raise the bar over time.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	One area of interest to effects artists is the interaction of rigid body and fluid sims. While this is not on the early release plan, in the medium term &ldquo;the idea of coupled rigid body dynamics and even soft bodies are on the radar,&rdquo; says Nordenstam. The destruction pipeline ideas seem really advanced and it is too early to outline how it will appear but clearly the team is researching complex debris, fracturing and destruction solutions.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	One of the most interesting comments made at the Users Group if you listen to the stage presentation was when Nordenstam referred to skipping the&nbsp;voxel polygonization or meshing step. This leads to direct ray tracing of level sets. In Naiad normally one had to mesh. A standard user workflow would be to mesh, and Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st will allow meshing &ndash; which is needed for many reasons. You might need it for collision detection for example. But to understand the new approach one needs to jump back a few years to a cocktail bar at SIGGRAPH and a meeting between Solid Angle&rsquo;s Marcos Fajardo and&nbsp;Nordenstam.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Over a set of martinis,&nbsp;Nordenstam&nbsp;and Fajardo&nbsp;wrote an Arnold plugin that rendered Naiad directly, avoiding meshing and this was even used in a 3D shark feature film called&nbsp;<i>Shark Night.</i></p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; recalls Fajardo. &ldquo;It was like 2 or 3 years ago, while we both were in Los Angeles, perhaps for SIGGRAPH? We met at the Marriott Marina del Rey for a quick drink, and Marcus explained how the Naiad API works, and I explained what geometric primitives we had in Arnold. Luckily, the Naiad API already provided a way to evaluate distance fields, and Arnold already provided an &lsquo;implicit&rsquo; primitive which allows to ray march an arbitrary field (which I wrote after reading these fantastic slides by I&ntilde;igo Quilez). So all the pieces were in place, and it was relatively easy to write a little Arnold shader that calls the Naiad API and then is attached to the implicit primitive. Yeah, the cool thing about this approach is that it doesn&rsquo;t need to tessellate the fluid, and also that it can capture topological changes in the fluid during motion blur (like when parts of the fluid surface break apart) which are always a pain to capture with tessellation. One of the early testers of this shader was Reliance Media Works in San Francisco for the movie Shark Night.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/29400594?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;" width="640"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Generally for CG volumes and smoke, these are rendered through a density field and are never tessellated or converted to meshes. Plus some people/companies have been known to not mesh back in Naiad &ndash; due to relatively slow serial execution and instead mesh in say Houdini.&nbsp;To address this, and learning from the Arnold experience in the cocktail bar,&nbsp;Nordenstam and the team have produced a system that no longer routinely needs to include a meshing stage. At SIGGRAPH this was working in Mental Ray. We asked if this was going to be an option or the standard way of now working. Nordenstam replied, &ldquo;I have no idea but I can&rsquo;t wait to find out what people do!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h3 style="margin: 2em 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif;

This reduces computation and storage.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	The adaptive data structure is specifically designed to allow the Autodesk team to shoot for a solution down the road that will not even require a problem like this to be required to be broken up into sub-sims. &ldquo;We are going to define a region at the surface and we will let the adaptive drop off below that,&rdquo; explains Nordenstam. A voxel off in the distance will be rendered to say one pixel. We don&rsquo;t need 10,000 voxels there and we don&rsquo;t need to simulate 10,000 voxels there.

For what would be viewable beyond the train, Hill notes that the filmmakers wanted to see a lot of depth in the backgrounds, not just a few CG buildings. But the sequence would span nearly two and a half minutes of footage &ndash; a significant city build for that length.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	That led to a decision to shoot backgrounds practically as much as possible, both for actually filling out the sequence and for reference. &ldquo;The overall VFX supe Phil Brennan had this great idea,&rdquo; says Hill, &ldquo;where he said, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t we look at filming, rather than on a train, but on an elevated freeway that&rsquo;s going through Tokyo.&rsquo; So we scouted some locations and found this elevated freeway in Shinjuku. We can drive up and down that all day and get lots of plates.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	However, at that point in the production the actual shots had not been designed, so rather than plates the team adopted a &lsquo;Google Streetview method&rsquo;. &ldquo;But instead of having a big panoramic cam on top of a van, we built a rig that had eight 45 degree angle RED EPICs that gave us massive resolution driving down all the massive lanes of the freeway,&rdquo; explains Hill. &ldquo;We let a bit of air out of the tires of the van and kept a constant 60 kilometers an hour. So if we shot at 48 fps we just needed to speed up the footage by 10 times to give us the 300 kilometers an hour required.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px;

says Hill, &ldquo;and then do a lot of one point perspective and two point perspective photogrammetry techniques to re-warp those plates and give them the depth and the nodal point offsets we couldn&rsquo;t get by merely taking the footage and placing it as a background. &rdquo;</p>\r\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="margin: 0px auto 20px;

notes Hill. &ldquo;We showed him the original footage, sped it up and showed it to him and he said it looks great and fast but if you say ignored the bit of text from the car registration plates, you could be almost anywhere. So we had to add lots of colorful billboards showing all manner of noodle bars and train signs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	&ldquo;And to give it a sense of speed you always want things much closer to camera, so they&rsquo;re really whipping past,&rdquo; adds Hill. &ldquo;So we were lowering all the heights of the gantries so that they would whip over the actors and the camera and give it a sense of speed as the trains go through it. It became a story point as they&rsquo;re always trying to avoid these gantries &ndash; ducking underneath them, interacting and leaping over them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Weta Digital retained close-up buildings captured with the multi-cam rig, although some were then re-projected onto geometry in Nuke to &ldquo;give us that two point perspective augmentations that we needed to be able to move the camera from where it sat on top of the van,&rdquo; says Hill.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	The back plates were solved first before Jackman and the other actors were filmed on set. The established environment was a little overcast without full sun which the DOP could then match on the greenscreen stage. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d have a keylight replicating the sun,&rdquo; says Hill. &ldquo;There was a giant propeller on a cherry picker with the 10K lights and one of the grips would just revolve it at a certain speed so you&rsquo;d have this light whipping over the background. It was however difficult to get a practical propeller to line up and cast a shadow exactly when Hugh ducks to avoid a gantry. In shots like that we didn&rsquo;t run any kind of shadowing and just did it in post.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_45688" style="margin: 0px auto 20px; padding: 4px; border: none; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; clear: both; background-color: rgb(241, 241, 241); color: rgb(136, 136, 136); line-height: 18px; text-align: center; border-top-left-radius: 0px; border-top-right-radius: 0px; border-bottom-right-radius: 0px; border-bottom-left-radius: 0px; width: 624px;">\r\n	<a class="fx_colorbox cboxElement" href="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DF-15352.jpg" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; outline: none; position: relative; display: inline-block;"><img alt="On-set train interior." class="wp-image-45688 " height="409" src="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DF-15352-1024x681.jpg" style="margin: 5px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;" width="614" /></a>\r\n	<p class="wp-caption-text" style="margin: 0px 0px 4px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n		On-set train interior.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Ultimately the practical fights and wire work were augmented with digital doubles, especially for some of the more dramatic scenes of the actors leaping to avoid gantries.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Scenes were rendered in RenderMan. &ldquo;We ran a very large environment but kind of a rolling one,&rdquo; explains Hill. &ldquo;So for each shot we&rsquo;d take about a kilometer of track with more or less a standard setup.

it had to look like he was doubting himself when he did it, with no eyebrows, no face, no eyes,&rdquo; states Hill.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px;

notes Hill. &ldquo;We were worried that he was going to look incredibly digital and that it was going to be very hard to make him look solid and real and not just like a mirrored surface. So we spent a long time replicating the multi-layered structure of brushed metal with a micro-facet solution to give us an anisotropic patina to him, but also give us a mirrored reflection underneath of the flatter parts in between the grooves. We took the original practical reference on set and had our shader writers actually started machining and milling different bits of metal and having a look at different responses from complicated materials.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	The Silver Samurai also carries a large sword that he is able to heat up and cut through almost any surface, including Wolverine&rsquo;s own adamantium claws. &ldquo;In the original previs the sword had a purple glow around it and left a trail behind it &ndash; almost Japanese anime style,&rdquo; says Hill. &ldquo;It looked cool but once we got into the lookdev of it, Jim wasn&rsquo;t really sure about the ethereal look. We went back to focusing on how katanas are actually made, how they fold them the metal and stick them in to the forge. You get a really interesting heat treatment across the sword while they&rsquo;re forging them &ndash; all the cracked patterns as the layers of the metal are coming away &ndash; you can see it&rsquo;s all based off the temperature of the metal. That&rsquo;s we ended up replicating. Once they&rsquo;ve cooled down they have this thin film interference layer which looks a lot like the color patinas you get around arc welding. Combining these things with the damage during the fight &ndash; it gave him a much more convincing look.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_45766" style="margin: 0px auto 20px; padding: 4px; border: none; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; clear: both; background-color: rgb(241, 241, 241); color: rgb(136, 136, 136); line-height: 18px; text-align: center; border-top-left-radius: 0px; border-top-right-radius: 0px; border-bottom-right-radius: 0px; border-bottom-left-radius: 0px; width: 624px;">\r\n	<a class="fx_colorbox cboxElement" href="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sd_360_24_328_JL.jpg" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; outline: none; position: relative; display: inline-block;"><img alt="Yashida is revealed to be inside the Samurai suit." class="wp-image-45766 " height="230" src="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sd_360_24_328_JL-1024x384.jpg" style="margin: 5px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;" width="614" /></a>\r\n	<p class="wp-caption-text" style="margin: 0px 0px 4px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n		Yashida is eventually revealed to be inside the Samurai suit.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	To replicate the environment, HDRIs were taken at different heights and served as reference for the final environment maps on the Silver Samurai. &ldquo;What that generally gives you is a real representation of what the samurai may have looked like in the scene,&rdquo; says Hill. &ldquo;But the DOP isn&rsquo;t necessarily lighting that dead space where the Samurai is, so we really had to fill in the blanks.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	&ldquo;We designed the lighting more procedurally,&rdquo; continues Hill. &ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s so reflective you can play with parallax in the lighting, so the lights can go behind pillars, say and it&rsquo;s not just the shadow &ndash; you&rsquo;re actually seeing the reflections of the lights disappearing and appearing &ndash; you get real depth.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Hill says Weta Digital had to light the Silver Samurai in a very graphical way. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just take a big area bounce light and have it as a crooked angle against those lines &ndash; it needs to be complimentary against his structure and the way he&rsquo;s designed. The lighting needs to be sympathetic to that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Eventually it is revealed that inside the Silver Samurai is Yashida, kept alive until he believes he can absorb Wolverine&rsquo;s powers. As he attempts to do so, the old Yashida transitions back to his younger self &ndash; a morph completed by Weta Digital which simulated various stages of the transformation. Full FACS sessions with a three-camera setup were undertaken to acquire facial features and gestures. &ldquo;We also recorded the full length of the scene with each actor in each make up stage 2 or 3 times with multiple cameras, which gave us precise reference shapes to aim for rather than always rebuilding from FACS primitive shapes,&rdquo; says Hill.</p>\r\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_45768" style="margin: 0px auto 20px; padding: 4px; border: none; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; clear: both; background-color: rgb(241, 241, 241); color: rgb(136, 136, 136); line-height: 18px; text-align: center; border-top-left-radius: 0px; border-top-right-radius: 0px; border-bottom-right-radius: 0px; border-bottom-left-radius: 0px; width: 624px;">\r\n	<a class="fx_colorbox cboxElement" href="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sd_370_155_300_JL.jpg" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; outline: none; position: relative; display: inline-block;"><img alt="Yashida transforms into his young self, momentarily." class="wp-image-45768 " height="230" src="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sd_370_155_300_JL-1024x384.jpg" style="margin: 5px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;" width="614" /></a>\r\n	<p class="wp-caption-text" style="margin: 0px 0px 4px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n		Yashida transforms into his young self, momentarily.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Artists paid attention to changes required in hair and eyebrows, for example, and the need to adapt sub-surface scattering. &ldquo;Some areas were more translucent and more leathery,&rdquo; explains Hill, &ldquo;so each of those stages were lookdev&rsquo;d independently and then we&rsquo;d be morphing in those individual maps in line with the blendshape transition to always keep the character looking photoreal.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Keeping each point in the transition looking like the actors when blending between was one of Weta Digital&rsquo;s main challenges. &ldquo;Some early tests tended to look like a entirely different character which was neither of the actors,&rdquo; says Hill. &ldquo;The other challenge was to keep the textural and sculptural blends working in tandem without the effect appearing as a wipe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	<strong>Find out more about how Weta Digital completed the Yashida transitions in this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fxphd.com/blog/de-age-vfx-fxphd-prof-tahl-niran-breaks-down-the-wolverine/" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; outline: none;">interview</a>&nbsp;with compositor and fxphd prof.

For example, Jim didn&rsquo;t want us to animate something so fantastic that say the stunt guys couldn&rsquo;t even do it, and then it would become an all-CG thing. So we worked really closely with them to do almost like a postvis over their stuntvis work. The stunt guys were able to get just a visceral intensity that would take a whole lot of time in the previs setting.

He received the top prize of &pound;80,000.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Sheffield based Ding, age 26, took his first ranking title on home soil since the 2005 China Open in Beijing. He has often struggled to handle the weight of expectation when he plays in China, but he produced some excellent snooker this week, not least in the final which saw him compile a century and seven more breaks over 50.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	That 2005 Ding victory was the catalyst for the explosion of interest in snooker in China. Since then, increasing numbers of Chinese players have earned places on the professional tour. Prior to this week, only Liang Wenbo had come close to emulating Ding&#39;s success, reaching one ranking final and briefly climbing into the top 16.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Now, Xiao looks the leading candidate to be the &#39;next best&#39; player from mainland China. He is one of the most improved players on the circuit over the past two years and played some superb snooker this week to reach his first ranking final. The 24-year-old Gloucester-based cueman can enjoy his biggest pay-day, &pound;35,000, and look ahead with confidence to the rest of the season.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Ding took the first two frames today with top breaks of 42 and 83, then Xiao made 62 and 67 for 2-2. Ding regained the lead with a 66 before Xiao came from 46-0 down in the sixth to make it 3-3. Ding pulled away at the end of the first session, knocking in 126 and 58 for 5-3 then taking the last frame of the session on the colours.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	On the resumption, Xiao pulled one back with a 78, only for Ding to reel off three frames in a row with 58, 78 and 81 for 9-4. Xiao threatened a fight back as he dominated the next two for 9-6, and led 45-0 in frame 16. But Ding then took his chance with a smooth 71 to seal the title.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&quot;Before the final I knew I needed to build an early lead, and I had to keep my safety strong to force my opponent to give me chances,&quot; said Ding. &quot;I built a three-frame-lead in the afternoon session because Xiao&#39;s safety was not as good as mine. But he managed to play relaxed and open frames in the evening so he did pull some frames back, after I had reached nine. I&#39;m just happy that I managed to win my tenth frame with a solid break.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&quot;Liang Wenbo has been in the final of this tournament too so hopefully there will be many more chances for the players from China. The young generation is growing up quickly so their days will come soon.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&quot;I had to let my emotions go after winning the tournament. This showed how much I wanted this title, I wanted it more than anybody. But there was less pressure on me than in the past when I played here in China.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&quot;I&#39;ve been changing my game a little bit with a friend&#39;s help, and training a lot. Now I can concentrate more on my snooker and this win means a lot to my career.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Xiao said: &quot;Today is a historic day, no matter whether I won or not. Two Chinese players performing a top class match on worldwide stage. I&#39;m so proud of myself, being a Chinese player. I&#39;ve always dreamed of winning a title but I wasn&#39;t very comfortable out there because this is my first ranking final. I&#39;ll be more relaxed next time.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&quot;It&#39;s a special experience for me. I hope not to disappear from sight and hopefully I will take part in many more world class tournaments.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&quot;Before this match my goal was to get into the top 32. I&#39;m in the top 32 now but I hope to raise my ranking steadily. It seems to be really hard for me to get into top 16 this season, but if I keep my form it&#39;s not impossible. I played well in the first few tournaments this season so hopefully I can achieve my goal.&quot;</p>\r\n', 'html', '', 1, 2, 'Pi', 1, 24, 11, 1, 1380179968, 1380179969, 0, 0);

It is production proven and about to be adopted for wide scale use by products like Autodesk&rsquo;s Maya and Side Effects Software&rsquo;s Houdini.

The specification was extended with local edits, creases, and other features, and formalized into a usable technique for animation in 1998 at Pixar. Until recently the technology had not enjoyed widespread adoption in animation. This is about to change. Pixar has now decided to release its subdivision patents and working codebase in the hope that giving away its high-performance GPU-accelerated code will create a standard for geometry throughout the animation industry.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<h3 style="margin: 2em 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 1; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n		<span style="line-height: 1;">Is Subdivision new?</span></h3>\r\n	<div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n			People have built high polygon models for years, but the same results can be achieved now with a much lower poly count with OpenSubdiv. Subdivision surfaces generally provide great advantages such as arbitrary topology and fantastic control. You can put the points where you need them and one does not need to add extra points &ndash; one just models naturally. Many people switched to some form of subdivision in around 2005-2006 when Maya first offered subdivision. Prior to Maya&rsquo;s adoption, studios with RenderMan would simply model in poly cages and pass those to RenderMan for subdivision. In 2005 Maya began offering an accurate CPU based &ldquo;preview&rdquo; which artists found invaluable.&nbsp;But the definition of subdivision varies greatly and it is hard to move a model from package to package or renderer to renderer and have them load and look the same. If the industry is fairly agreed that subdivision is a good idea &ndash; and even the geometry primitive of the future &ndash; then, as Pixar TD Manuel Kraemer points out, &ldquo;we should at least agree on what the definition of a subdivision surface -&nbsp;Catmull-Clark or whatever &ndash; we should agree on what it&nbsp;<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">really</em>&nbsp;is and the devil&nbsp;<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">is</em>&nbsp;in the detail!&rdquo;</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n			OpenSubdiv&nbsp;is a consistent implementation of subdivision, with GPU and CPU versions, and one that promises greater interoperability and interchange &ndash; in short, it offers a professional standard. The resulting output from an&nbsp;OpenSubdiv pipeline is streamlined but it also means that models will look the same and have the same controls, weights and look in a variety of packages, something not true before OpenSubdiv.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n			OpenSubdiv offers features like creases (edge sharpness), limit surface evaluation, hierarchical edits. Plus it offers modeling speed and memory reduction (very important with sculpting), and it offers interoperability.</p>\r\n		<h5 style="margin: 1.5em 0px 7px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 16px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n			An example in practice</h5>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n			Both Maya&rsquo;s animation interface and Pixar&rsquo;s proprietary Presto animation system can take up to 100ms to subdivide a character of 30,000 polygons to the second level of subdivision (500,000 polygons).&nbsp;<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">But</em>&nbsp;doing the same thing with OpenSubdiv&rsquo;s GPU codepath&nbsp;takes 3ms and allows the user to see the smooth, accurate limit surface&nbsp;at all times. The aim of&nbsp;OpenSubdiv is to allow the artist to work with a more faithful representation of what you are doing. It can render faster, and allow for greater interoperability. But this is not a plugin.&nbsp;You cannot simply run your existing high poly count models through OpenSubdiv to make them faster. Rather, you need to think about modeling at much lower resolution and let the subdivision process &ndash; managed by OpenSubdiv &ndash; provide the high quality, high poly count surface at render time.</p>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n			There are some key aspects to the&nbsp;OpenSubdiv project, including some really interesting new opportunities:</p>\r\n		<ol style="margin: 0px 1.5em 1.5em 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 1.5em; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n			<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n				Simplicity with&nbsp;edges/creases</li>\r\n			<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n				Efficiency with textures</li>\r\n			<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n				GPU implementation</li>\r\n			<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n				Hierarchical modeling</li>\r\n		</ol>\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n			But before looking at those current issues it is worth looking at some of the background of OpenSubdiv.</p>\r\n	</div>\r\n	<h3 style="margin: 2em 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 1; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n		<a name="Heritage" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); cursor: pointer; outline: none;"></a>Heritage and background</h3>\r\n	<div class="pullquote right" style="margin: 0px; padding: 20px 0px 20px 30px; border: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; width: 307.34375px; text-align: center; line-height: 26px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); float: right; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n			&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very excited&hellip;It&rsquo;s nice to have a standard implementation that&rsquo;s going to produce the same results in all&nbsp;software.

Pixar has heavily promoted&nbsp;OpenSubdiv in an effort to one day have a powerful interchange format that both works very quickly on the GPU and very reliably on the CPU. While subdiv did exist outside the work Pixar was using internally, most implementations were based on papers and research done by staff at Pixar. And ever since Pixar moved to allow their research to be in the open source community many other companies have started to come on board. The team at Luxology licensed the core technology before there was even a formal &lsquo;OpenSubdiv program&rsquo;.</p>\r\n	<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n		Autodesk has aggressively supported Pixar both for their internal tools and now in Maya so that soon everyone can benefit. Side Effects Software is coming on board with Houdini and now even realtime applications are appearing. Remarkably it is only a year since&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fxguide.com/featured/pixars-encouraging-performance-by-giving-away-the-good-stuff/" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; outline: none;">Pixar announced their decision</a>&nbsp;to put subdiv into the open source community. The idea came from a pitch that Manuel Kraemer made to Bill Polson, Pixar&rsquo;s&nbsp;Director of Industry Strategy. As Polson recalls it, pretty much everything that Kraemer pitched in that meeting has come to fruition today. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think enough credit can go to&nbsp;Manuel Kraemer,&rdquo; Polson says. &ldquo;A few years ago he came into my office and said, &lsquo;Bill, I think we need to do some real work with subdivision and try and get it to be an industry standard. He kind of laid it all out on my whiteboard &ndash; I wish I&rsquo;d taken a picture of that whiteboard!&rdquo;.</p>\r\n	<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n		The concern Pixar&rsquo;s internal team had was that it just made too much sense to not have a standard, but as Pixar owned many of the key patents and the keys to RenderMan, it would be hard for anyone else to do as good a job, or deal with some of the complexity like facevarying, hierarchy or the important &lsquo;creasing&rsquo;. This meant that a less than optimal version could, de facto, become a standard if Pixar kept quiet and withheld support of their technology and patents. Pixar would then be faced with having a standard that was inferior to their internal model and all hopes of interoperability would be lost. Furthermore, for subdiv to work well Pixar wanted a great GPU implementation and any graphics card company would, for the same reasons, end up not supporting the possibly &lsquo;secret&rsquo; superior Pixar version. By Pixar adopting the open source model it stands a great chance of companies like Autodesk, The Foundry, &nbsp;Smith Micro Software (Poser)&nbsp;<em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">and</em>&nbsp;Nvidia completely and faithfully supporting the Pixar model, and that benefits everyone.</p>\r\n	<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n		In giving their subdiv away Pixar would get back both industry adoption (and thus hardware support) and Pixar artists &ndash; and artists worldwide &ndash; could work more effectively. Pixar has actually done comprehensive studies on artists animating with IK rigs etc that show not only is responsiveness cost effective, but as systems pass certain responsiveness thresholds (50 ~ 60 frames per second in terms of interactive refresh times) artists grip their pens or mice less firmly, relaxing arm and wrist muscles and thus reducing strain injuries. By making their artists able to enjoy faster responsiveness, Pixar saves production time &ndash; and more importantly their artists are healthier.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n');

In this context it is a bridge between a few things. Firstly, it is a bridge between procedural and explicit water/gas simulation. But it is also a bridge between the Naiad developers and the original ICE developers (the name Naiad was itself a reference to Greek mythology). ICE is/was one of the great innovations from the XSI Softimage team. In mid&nbsp;2008, the Softimage announced XSI 7. According to Wikipedia, XSI 7, &ldquo;introduced the ICE (Interactive Creative Environment) architecture. ICE is a visual programming platform that allows users to extend the capabilities of Softimage quickly and intuitively using a node-based dataflow diagram. This enables artists to create complex 3D effects and tools without scripting. Among the main uses for ICE are procedural modeling, deformation, rigging and particle simulation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Naiad was a nodal based fluid simulator which proved itself in production as being able to deliver incredible and subtle water simulations.

Nordenstam was the co-founder Naiad and is now at Autodesk. &ldquo;Obviously an artist needs an environment to edit the graphs or nodes, and look at the preview of the result, and of course light and render, so we have picked Maya as the first environment to do that in as we know Maya will definitely be one of the environments people would want to use it in. But in the near future you would be able to export the graph you make in Maya and compute it independently in very much the way one might do with a Naiad Graph, and then solve it on the command line. We want to be able to export a sim and run it off the command line, but it opens it up to being finished perhaps on the &lsquo;cloud&rsquo;, say.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Interestingly, in this respect&nbsp;Project Bifr&ouml;st is an engine in much the same way as the recently released Houdini Engine. And again Houdini Engine can run inside Maya, but is not limited to Maya. &ldquo;It is interesting,&rdquo; says Nordenstam, &ldquo;Naiad was sort of a engine &ndash; like Houdini Engine &ndash; and&nbsp;Project Bifr&ouml;st very much is an engine, so&nbsp;we have been building an engine and what we are asking ourselves now is which applications to put this engine into. It&rsquo;s really exciting actually.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	As a cloud implementation is very possible, this opens the door to exploring even a mobile implementation. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the power of what we are doing, we are decoupling authoring environments from compute,&rdquo; says Nordenstam. &ldquo;They could be the same, but in theory you could imagine an iPad app where you use your finger to move (Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st) nodes around, but the actual compute is in the cloud. We are certainly not announcing that, but this is what the architecture could allow.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Just as Naiad before it, the code for Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st is written for multi-threading but it is being built in a more distributed, multi-machine approach than Naiad ever was. For example, on Naiad you could not run a single fluid simulation on more than one machine, on Project Bifr&ouml;st you can. Even with the multi-threading the actual simulation had to be on one machine. A multiple machine solution working on one graph would make the Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st implementation suitable for say running on the Intel Xeon Phi. But Autodesk is exploring all implementations including GPU implementations.</p>\r\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="margin: 0px auto 20px; padding: 4px; border: none; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif;

What is new is how the graph is evaluated. Other node-based software (including Naiad) present the graph to be evaluated in the form of a graph, making graph traversal itself a key part of the evaluation. The computer needs to traverse thousands of nodes to compute the solution. Each node may be simple, and often they are, but surprisingly the time taken traversing the data structures is significant.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	In the real world, projects produce very complex graphs and so&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st tries to directly address this for the first time. The team has decoupled the user&rsquo;s UI representation from the computer&rsquo;s data graph representation. This means there is an internal system that compiles the user&rsquo;s graph on the fly into more efficient machine code, and of course all the computer worries about is the output of this. In effect it compiles the graphical nodes into hard coded C++ code on the fly thus dramatically improving performance. Nordenstam suggests that this hard coded code that gets complied and runs is like having an artist working on a shot in the node based view and having &ldquo;your best friend sitting beside you who says &lsquo;write me your best C++ program that does exactly what my graph does&rsquo; &ndash; and then that run that for me!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Critically, this real time compile does not have to just traverse the tree, &ldquo;it does this magic analysis of your graph and generates the code from the tree in a non-graph form.&rdquo; To use an example to illustrate this, imagine you have to create four nodes:</p>\r\n<ol style="margin: 0px 1.5em 1.5em 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 1.5em; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n		<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.5;">create&nbsp;</span>fluid<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;and then</span></li>\r\n	<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n		<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.5;">add gravity&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n	<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n		<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.5;">do collisions</span></li>\r\n	<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n		<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.5;">cache to disc</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	In&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st it would not run the first node, then run the second etc. Instead it would look at everything and then it would explode all those nodes to the lowest level sub-networks, exposing all the sub-nets and having a huge real nodal tree. Then, knowing what all these subnets do (including loops), it produces efficient machine code, and then runs that rather than a series of steps one after another as mirrored directly in the higher level UI.&nbsp;This is much more than an old-school Shake trick of concatenating like-type nodes. This in no way stops one from viewing the process at any stage in the graph, as&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st recompiles instantly, but just to that point in the graph, by doing a partial nodal tree compile.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	The interesting thing is, if Autodesk decides it wants to support a GPU version, then&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st would just compile GPU code instead. It is a very elegant solution for a multi-targeted product code base. &ldquo;Not only that,&rdquo; suggests&nbsp;Nordenstam, &ldquo;we could say &lsquo;Hey, let&rsquo;s generate Xbox code, let&rsquo;s generate Playstation 4 code, for example. This can go quite far. It is the next generation graphing type technology. I think you are going to see a lot more people doing this sort of thing in the future, and we are one of the first.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="margin: 0px auto 20px; padding: 4px;

In a program like Maya one would be hard pushed to view it, it would either not fit in GPU RAM or it would cause large amounts of swapping. From an artist&rsquo;s point of view the user experience would be poor. Autodesk is very keen to make any implementation very interactive, so the team has developed a paging system that pages in low res for distant smoke and only high res in the close up. This is just a viewing tool but the same approach can be found in the simulation side. &ldquo;That is the other big exciting thing in&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st &ndash; this&nbsp;<b>adaptive data structure</b>&nbsp;that we are doing,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Nordenstam.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	<a class="fx_colorbox cboxElement alignright" href="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/voxels.jpg" style="margin: 4px 0px 0px 24px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; outline: none; display: inline-block; float: right; position: relative;"><img alt="voxels" class="alignright  wp-image-46399" height="183" src="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/voxels-320x230.jpg" style="margin: 4px 0px 12px 24px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; display: inline; float: right;" width="253" /></a>The adaptive data structure was shown indirectly at the Autodesk Users Group in Anaheim. &ldquo;We are able to represent a single fluid now finally &ndash; adaptively,&rdquo; adds Nordenstam. &ldquo;This area for example is higher resolution than that, so we can have a single fluid that actually is fundamentally represented at a higher level on the surface where you want the detail than say at the bottom. And no one else is doing this that I am aware in the commercial space.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	The distributed nature of Bifrost combined with the heavy use of adaptivity led to the development of a native Bifrost voxel structure as opposed to simply using OpenVDB.&nbsp; However, OpenVDB may still be supported as a one of the voxel file-formats.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	In a sense Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st is a visual programming environment. Through the clever use of sub-nets and compounding the team still presents a very simple high level workflow to an artist. But don&rsquo;t worry if you are a hard core TD, you can still open it up and get in under the hood for some really complex custom solutions.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	<a class="fx_colorbox cboxElement alignleft" href="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/smoke.jpg" style="margin: 4px 24px 0px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; outline: none; display: inline-block; float: left; position: relative;"><img alt="smoke" class="alignleft  wp-image-46400" height="217" src="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/smoke-320x256.jpg" style="margin: 4px 24px 12px 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; display: inline; float: left;" width="271" /></a></p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Is it just for fluid sims and gas sims? Or is Bifr&ouml;st&nbsp;tech applicable to other simulations? The question is hard to really answer today, but certainly one gets the impression the team has a very long term view. Even before the resources and support of Autodesk came to bear, the former Naiad team wanted to extend their work to rigid body simulations, particles, elastic equations and soft bodies. And&nbsp;Nordenstam feels it is &ldquo;even more realistic to do that now because we are at Autodesk and they have more resources and great people, so I have even more faith we can succeed.&rdquo; An example would be deforming geometry based on rules or procedurally in the same way fluids are created.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Naiad is in the DNA of Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st but the code is all new and it benefits from the experience of the ICE Softimage programmers who joined the ex-Naiad team. It is not just Naiad 2, it is a visual programming environment for fluids that learns from both the graphical approach of Naiad and the power of ICE. An example of this is how the ICE team helped allow the Naiad graph nodes be grouped into super nodes &ndash; something not possible in the old Naiad. Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st has both complex new nodes and the ability to enter nodes and modify them. To write your own nodes in Naiad you had to write your own C++ nodes, with&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st most of the nodes will be more like ICE nodes internally, and you will be able to adjust them, study them and tweak them without having to write any code.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Away from the technical underpinnings, most artists need tools to say selectively accentuate peaks or for sharpening features, removing holes or smoothing areas. These &lsquo;crafting&rsquo; steps are what one needs in production &ndash; after all, fluid sims in production are art directed and modified based on the director&rsquo;s vision and the needs of the story. Here Nordenstam decides to quote and reference Bruce Lee of all people. The analogy is based on Lee&rsquo;s use of multiple martial techniques to win a bout. &ldquo;One style does not win the fight,&rdquo; quotes Nordenstam. &ldquo;I have taken the same view with the&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st design. Proceduralism is a very powerful thing but it is not the only style that can win, and I think if you only use it you will loose, and so my opinion is that interactive workflows &ndash; like Maya has traditionally excelled at &ndash; things like interactive modeling and interactive animation &ndash; that is all very powerful. A lot of the tasks such as fixing holes etc lend themselves to the interactive workflow in the viewport. So we don&rsquo;t want to force proceduralism&nbsp;onto a user. The trick is to always keep an eye on whenever we try and make a workflow or a task for an artist in the practical world of day to day, we need to ask is this something you want to do in the viewport with a mouse or is this something that you can control with a parameter, is it interactive or procedural?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	At the end of the day, image quality will define the success of the project. For example, does the new&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st handle very thin sheets of water (which can be an issue with fluids &lsquo;spider webbing&rsquo;)? &ldquo;First,&rdquo; says Nordenstam, &ldquo;I would claim that you could do some of that stuff already with Naiad. I would certainly expect that with the same people behind Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st you will have a lot of the same power and flexibility and a lot of that should be working right out of the box. It should be in pretty good shape.&rdquo; With reference to the specific problem of thin sheets of water and the surface tension acting upon them, Nordenstam&nbsp;agreed that recent research with explicit mesh based patches in this area is exciting, which is very close to finite element analysis, (and further away from a fluid sim FLIP approach).</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Autodesk is actively exploring some hybrid solutions, and&nbsp;Nordenstam says, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be too surprised if in the future if all of a sudden we introduced some mesh based solution. But a lot of people are working on this and who knows if we will be the first ones!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Certainly, image quality is central to the research and key to the success of Naiad when it was launched.&nbsp;Nordenstam: &ldquo;I personally think that one of the key things about Naiad was that there were a lot of things we did not try and do with Naiad, all the things like dynamics. But I really think we did kick the crap out of numerical methods that were stable, and did produce a renderable mesh that did look like liquid and not rice pudding! That was something we really worked hard on.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Users should expect that level of image quality from Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st as it is based on the same meshing algorithm as Naiad, slightly improved but similar. The team remain obsessed with great high end quality for major visual effects, and beyond. It is worth remembering that in the Naiad days the guys could only produce particles or meshes or voxels &ndash; they had no influence or say in rendering. The company was new and small. Neither of those statements are true of Autodesk. &ldquo;With Autodesk we have a set of really powerful renderers that we have a really close relationship with, including V-Ray, Mental Ray, Arnold and RenderMan,&rdquo; outlines Nordenstam. &ldquo;In time, I expect the quality from Bifr&ouml;st -&nbsp;with time &ndash; will greatly exceed anything Naiad could do.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	This project is aiming to seriously raise the bar over time.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	One area of interest to effects artists is the interaction of rigid body and fluid sims. While this is not on the early release plan, in the medium term &ldquo;the idea of coupled rigid body dynamics and even soft bodies are on the radar,&rdquo; says Nordenstam. The destruction pipeline ideas seem really advanced and it is too early to outline how it will appear but clearly the team is researching complex debris, fracturing and destruction solutions.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	One of the most interesting comments made at the Users Group if you listen to the stage presentation was when Nordenstam referred to skipping the&nbsp;voxel polygonization or meshing step. This leads to direct ray tracing of level sets. In Naiad normally one had to mesh. A standard user workflow would be to mesh, and Project&nbsp;Bifr&ouml;st will allow meshing &ndash; which is needed for many reasons. You might need it for collision detection for example. But to understand the new approach one needs to jump back a few years to a cocktail bar at SIGGRAPH and a meeting between Solid Angle&rsquo;s Marcos Fajardo and&nbsp;Nordenstam.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Over a set of martinis,&nbsp;Nordenstam&nbsp;and Fajardo&nbsp;wrote an Arnold plugin that rendered Naiad directly, avoiding meshing and this was even used in a 3D shark feature film called&nbsp;<i>Shark Night.</i></p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; recalls Fajardo. &ldquo;It was like 2 or 3 years ago, while we both were in Los Angeles, perhaps for SIGGRAPH? We met at the Marriott Marina del Rey for a quick drink, and Marcus explained how the Naiad API works, and I explained what geometric primitives we had in Arnold. Luckily, the Naiad API already provided a way to evaluate distance fields, and Arnold already provided an &lsquo;implicit&rsquo; primitive which allows to ray march an arbitrary field (which I wrote after reading these fantastic slides by I&ntilde;igo Quilez). So all the pieces were in place, and it was relatively easy to write a little Arnold shader that calls the Naiad API and then is attached to the implicit primitive. Yeah, the cool thing about this approach is that it doesn&rsquo;t need to tessellate the fluid, and also that it can capture topological changes in the fluid during motion blur (like when parts of the fluid surface break apart) which are always a pain to capture with tessellation. One of the early testers of this shader was Reliance Media Works in San Francisco for the movie Shark Night.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/29400594?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;" width="640"></iframe></p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Generally for CG volumes and smoke, these are rendered through a density field and are never tessellated or converted to meshes. Plus some people/companies have been known to not mesh back in Naiad &ndash; due to relatively slow serial execution and instead mesh in say Houdini.&nbsp;To address this, and learning from the Arnold experience in the cocktail bar,&nbsp;Nordenstam and the team have produced a system that no longer routinely needs to include a meshing stage. At SIGGRAPH this was working in Mental Ray. We asked if this was going to be an option or the standard way of now working. Nordenstam replied, &ldquo;I have no idea but I can&rsquo;t wait to find out what people do!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h3 style="margin: 2em 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif;

A voxel off in the distance will be rendered to say one pixel. We don&rsquo;t need 10,000 voxels there and we don&rsquo;t need to simulate 10,000 voxels there.

That spot, which was also the first ad NORMON had even created for television, features Wimbledon champion Manolo Santana engaging in a virtual tennis match. &ldquo;We had to film it all against green, and handle the design, as well as the composition and supervision of the campaign,&rdquo; explains Moure. &ldquo;We decided to create a 3D set, and film it in order to be able to have previsualisation live, which aided us with the realization of the spot.

During that time, a great amount of Westerns were shot on Spanish soils, as well as other genres of films. The American industry always trusted Spanish artists, and this is still true for today, nowadays wherever you go, be it New York, London, L.A., Sydney, just to name a few of the cities that are home to the most famous production houses, you will find a Spanish member in their staff.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<hr class="clear" style="background-color: rgb(221, 221, 221); color: rgb(221, 221, 221); clear: both; float: none; width: 683px; height: 0px; margin: 0px; border: none; font-size: 1px; line-height: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif;" />\r\n<div class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_46085" style="margin: 4px 24px 20px 0px; padding: 4px; border: none; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; display: inline; float: left; background-color: rgb(241, 241, 241); color: rgb(136, 136, 136); line-height: 18px; text-align: center; border-top-left-radius: 0px; border-top-right-radius: 0px; border-bottom-right-radius: 0px; border-bottom-left-radius: 0px; width: 298px;">\r\n	<a class="fx_colorbox cboxElement" href="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Normon_LAB_BEFORE_02.jpg" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; outline: none; position: relative; display: inline-block;"><img alt="Greenscreen plate." class="wp-image-46085 " height="162" src="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Normon_LAB_BEFORE_02-320x180.jpg" style="margin: 5px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;" width="288" /></a>\r\n	<p class="wp-caption-text" style="margin: 0px 0px 4px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n		Greenscreen plate.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_46087" style="margin: 4px 0px 20px 24px; padding: 4px; border: none; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; display: inline; float: right; background-color: rgb(241, 241, 241); color: rgb(136, 136, 136); line-height: 18px; text-align: center; border-top-left-radius: 0px; border-top-right-radius: 0px; border-bottom-right-radius: 0px; border-bottom-left-radius: 0px; width: 298px;">\r\n	<a class="fx_colorbox cboxElement" href="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Normon_LAB_AFTER_02.jpg" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; outline: none; position: relative; display: inline-block;"><img alt="Final shot." class="wp-image-46087 " height="162" src="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Normon_LAB_AFTER_02-320x180.jpg" style="margin: 5px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;" width="288" /></a>\r\n	<p class="wp-caption-text" style="margin: 0px 0px 4px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n		Final shot.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<hr class="clear" style="background-color: rgb(221, 221, 221); color: rgb(221, 221, 221); clear: both; float: none; width: 683px; height: 0px; margin: 0px; border: none; font-size: 1px; line-height: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif;" />\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	&ldquo;This is due to the great versatility of Spanish artists and our great passion for our work,&rdquo; says Moure. &ldquo;We are people who truly love their work, and who are willing to go above and beyond, we don&rsquo;t settle for what we know but are always searching to surpass our limits, which has ushered us to win the Fifa World Cup, Roland Garros, etc, in the end the highest level of competition is what we like.

Then on top of that there was a secondary sculpt, and there was a bit of keyframing and manual sculpting too. They also wanted micro movements as well, hard to pick up in matchmove, where if he twitched his hand or his neck shifted ever so slightly, they wanted to convey that motion in the pins, then all that was keyframed in Maya as another layer of motion. It was rendered in V-Ray.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	&ldquo;A lot of the interactivity with Yashida was done as a 2D solve in the end out of Nuke,&rdquo; adds Julian Dimsey. &ldquo;The lighting department gave out a bunch of passes to allow the compers to displace and warp Yashida&rsquo;s skin and his pyjamas based on the movement of the pins.

For what would be viewable beyond the train, Hill notes that the filmmakers wanted to see a lot of depth in the backgrounds, not just a few CG buildings. But the sequence would span nearly two and a half minutes of footage &ndash; a significant city build for that length.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	That led to a decision to shoot backgrounds practically as much as possible, both for actually filling out the sequence and for reference. &ldquo;The overall VFX supe Phil Brennan had this great idea,&rdquo; says Hill, &ldquo;where he said, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t we look at filming, rather than on a train, but on an elevated freeway that&rsquo;s going through Tokyo.&rsquo; So we scouted some locations and found this elevated freeway in Shinjuku. We can drive up and down that all day and get lots of plates.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	However, at that point in the production the actual shots had not been designed, so rather than plates the team adopted a &lsquo;Google Streetview method&rsquo;. &ldquo;But instead of having a big panoramic cam on top of a van, we built a rig that had eight 45 degree angle RED EPICs that gave us massive resolution driving down all the massive lanes of the freeway,&rdquo; explains Hill. &ldquo;We let a bit of air out of the tires of the van and kept a constant 60 kilometers an hour. So if we shot at 48 fps we just needed to speed up the footage by 10 times to give us the 300 kilometers an hour required.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px;

says Hill, &ldquo;and then do a lot of one point perspective and two point perspective photogrammetry techniques to re-warp those plates and give them the depth and the nodal point offsets we couldn&rsquo;t get by merely taking the footage and placing it as a background. &rdquo;</p>\r\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="margin: 0px auto 20px;

notes Hill. &ldquo;We showed him the original footage, sped it up and showed it to him and he said it looks great and fast but if you say ignored the bit of text from the car registration plates, you could be almost anywhere. So we had to add lots of colorful billboards showing all manner of noodle bars and train signs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	&ldquo;And to give it a sense of speed you always want things much closer to camera, so they&rsquo;re really whipping past,&rdquo; adds Hill. &ldquo;So we were lowering all the heights of the gantries so that they would whip over the actors and the camera and give it a sense of speed as the trains go through it. It became a story point as they&rsquo;re always trying to avoid these gantries &ndash; ducking underneath them, interacting and leaping over them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Weta Digital retained close-up buildings captured with the multi-cam rig, although some were then re-projected onto geometry in Nuke to &ldquo;give us that two point perspective augmentations that we needed to be able to move the camera from where it sat on top of the van,&rdquo; says Hill.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	The back plates were solved first before Jackman and the other actors were filmed on set. The established environment was a little overcast without full sun which the DOP could then match on the greenscreen stage. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d have a keylight replicating the sun,&rdquo; says Hill. &ldquo;There was a giant propeller on a cherry picker with the 10K lights and one of the grips would just revolve it at a certain speed so you&rsquo;d have this light whipping over the background. It was however difficult to get a practical propeller to line up and cast a shadow exactly when Hugh ducks to avoid a gantry. In shots like that we didn&rsquo;t run any kind of shadowing and just did it in post.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_45688" style="margin: 0px auto 20px; padding: 4px; border: none; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; clear: both; background-color: rgb(241, 241, 241); color: rgb(136, 136, 136); line-height: 18px; text-align: center; border-top-left-radius: 0px; border-top-right-radius: 0px; border-bottom-right-radius: 0px; border-bottom-left-radius: 0px; width: 624px;">\r\n	<a class="fx_colorbox cboxElement" href="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DF-15352.jpg" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; outline: none; position: relative; display: inline-block;"><img alt="On-set train interior." class="wp-image-45688 " height="409" src="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DF-15352-1024x681.jpg" style="margin: 5px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;" width="614" /></a>\r\n	<p class="wp-caption-text" style="margin: 0px 0px 4px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n		On-set train interior.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Ultimately the practical fights and wire work were augmented with digital doubles, especially for some of the more dramatic scenes of the actors leaping to avoid gantries.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Scenes were rendered in RenderMan. &ldquo;We ran a very large environment but kind of a rolling one,&rdquo; explains Hill. &ldquo;So for each shot we&rsquo;d take about a kilometer of track with more or less a standard setup. The first thing we do is render it, see how it looked, judge the speed, or add more drama, adjust the height, the spacing between the gantries. Then we did shot-specific things like if there was a particular gap in the background that had a lovely view to the city we&rsquo;d try and not block that with a giant billboard, or if there was a particularly nasty looking building then we certainly would.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	&ldquo;We also had to think about how are we going to deal with extra bounce lights from buildings that don&rsquo;t exist &ndash; say red buildings &ndash; and how to represent those back onto the train or onto Hugh. They do get fed into an IBL but there&rsquo;s also an element of over-cranking it.

it had to look like he was doubting himself when he did it, with no eyebrows, no face, no eyes,&rdquo; states Hill.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Perhaps the main challenge for Weta Digital was realizing the Silver Samurai&rsquo;s highly reflective surface. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s pretty much chrome,&rdquo; notes Hill. &ldquo;We were worried that he was going to look incredibly digital and that it was going to be very hard to make him look solid and real and not just like a mirrored surface. So we spent a long time replicating the multi-layered structure of brushed metal with a micro-facet solution to give us an anisotropic patina to him, but also give us a mirrored reflection underneath of the flatter parts in between the grooves. We took the original practical reference on set and had our shader writers actually started machining and milling different bits of metal and having a look at different responses from complicated materials.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	The Silver Samurai also carries a large sword that he is able to heat up and cut through almost any surface, including Wolverine&rsquo;s own adamantium claws. &ldquo;In the original previs the sword had a purple glow around it and left a trail behind it &ndash; almost Japanese anime style,&rdquo; says Hill. &ldquo;It looked cool but once we got into the lookdev of it, Jim wasn&rsquo;t really sure about the ethereal look. We went back to focusing on how katanas are actually made, how they fold them the metal and stick them in to the forge. You get a really interesting heat treatment across the sword while they&rsquo;re forging them &ndash; all the cracked patterns as the layers of the metal are coming away &ndash; you can see it&rsquo;s all based off the temperature of the metal. That&rsquo;s we ended up replicating. Once they&rsquo;ve cooled down they have this thin film interference layer which looks a lot like the color patinas you get around arc welding. Combining these things with the damage during the fight &ndash; it gave him a much more convincing look.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_45766" style="margin: 0px auto 20px; padding: 4px; border: none; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; clear: both; background-color: rgb(241, 241, 241); color: rgb(136, 136, 136); line-height: 18px; text-align: center; border-top-left-radius: 0px; border-top-right-radius: 0px; border-bottom-right-radius: 0px; border-bottom-left-radius: 0px; width: 624px;">\r\n	<a class="fx_colorbox cboxElement" href="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sd_360_24_328_JL.jpg" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; outline: none; position: relative; display: inline-block;"><img alt="Yashida is revealed to be inside the Samurai suit." class="wp-image-45766 " height="230" src="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sd_360_24_328_JL-1024x384.jpg" style="margin: 5px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;" width="614" /></a>\r\n	<p class="wp-caption-text" style="margin: 0px 0px 4px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n		Yashida is eventually revealed to be inside the Samurai suit.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	To replicate the environment, HDRIs were taken at different heights and served as reference for the final environment maps on the Silver Samurai. &ldquo;What that generally gives you is a real representation of what the samurai may have looked like in the scene,&rdquo; says Hill. &ldquo;But the DOP isn&rsquo;t necessarily lighting that dead space where the Samurai is, so we really had to fill in the blanks.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	&ldquo;We designed the lighting more procedurally,&rdquo; continues Hill. &ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s so reflective you can play with parallax in the lighting, so the lights can go behind pillars, say and it&rsquo;s not just the shadow &ndash; you&rsquo;re actually seeing the reflections of the lights disappearing and appearing &ndash; you get real depth.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Hill says Weta Digital had to light the Silver Samurai in a very graphical way. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just take a big area bounce light and have it as a crooked angle against those lines &ndash; it needs to be complimentary against his structure and the way he&rsquo;s designed. The lighting needs to be sympathetic to that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Eventually it is revealed that inside the Silver Samurai is Yashida, kept alive until he believes he can absorb Wolverine&rsquo;s powers. As he attempts to do so, the old Yashida transitions back to his younger self &ndash; a morph completed by Weta Digital which simulated various stages of the transformation. Full FACS sessions with a three-camera setup were undertaken to acquire facial features and gestures. &ldquo;We also recorded the full length of the scene with each actor in each make up stage 2 or 3 times with multiple cameras, which gave us precise reference shapes to aim for rather than always rebuilding from FACS primitive shapes,&rdquo; says Hill.</p>\r\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_45768" style="margin: 0px auto 20px; padding: 4px; border: none; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; clear: both; background-color: rgb(241, 241, 241); color: rgb(136, 136, 136); line-height: 18px; text-align: center; border-top-left-radius: 0px; border-top-right-radius: 0px; border-bottom-right-radius: 0px; border-bottom-left-radius: 0px; width: 624px;">\r\n	<a class="fx_colorbox cboxElement" href="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sd_370_155_300_JL.jpg" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; outline: none; position: relative; display: inline-block;"><img alt="Yashida transforms into his young self, momentarily." class="wp-image-45768 " height="230" src="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sd_370_155_300_JL-1024x384.jpg" style="margin: 5px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;" width="614" /></a>\r\n	<p class="wp-caption-text" style="margin: 0px 0px 4px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n		Yashida transforms into his young self, momentarily.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Artists paid attention to changes required in hair and eyebrows, for example, and the need to adapt sub-surface scattering. &ldquo;Some areas were more translucent and more leathery,&rdquo; explains Hill, &ldquo;so each of those stages were lookdev&rsquo;d independently and then we&rsquo;d be morphing in those individual maps in line with the blendshape transition to always keep the character looking photoreal.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Keeping each point in the transition looking like the actors when blending between was one of Weta Digital&rsquo;s main challenges. &ldquo;Some early tests tended to look like a entirely different character which was neither of the actors,&rdquo; says Hill. &ldquo;The other challenge was to keep the textural and sculptural blends working in tandem without the effect appearing as a wipe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	<strong>Find out more about how Weta Digital completed the Yashida transitions in this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fxphd.com/blog/de-age-vfx-fxphd-prof-tahl-niran-breaks-down-the-wolverine/" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; outline: none;">interview</a>&nbsp;with compositor and fxphd prof.

For example, Jim didn&rsquo;t want us to animate something so fantastic that say the stunt guys couldn&rsquo;t even do it, and then it would become an all-CG thing. So we worked really closely with them to do almost like a postvis over their stuntvis work. The stunt guys were able to get just a visceral intensity that would take a whole lot of time in the previs setting. But we could give it so much more context than just in the practical setting of their warehouse.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_45697" style="margin: 4px 0px 20px 24px; padding: 4px; border: none; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; display: inline; float: right; background-color: rgb(241, 241, 241); color: rgb(136, 136, 136); line-height: 18px; text-align: center; border-top-left-radius: 0px; border-top-right-radius: 0px; border-bottom-right-radius: 0px; border-bottom-left-radius: 0px; width: 330px;">\r\n	<a class="fx_colorbox cboxElement" href="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/W2_AppvdIm_SS_vs_Logan_071513.jpg" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(136, 0, 0); text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; outline: none; position: relative; display: inline-block;"><img alt="Silver Samurai previs." class="size-medium wp-image-45697" height="180" src="http://www.fxguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/W2_AppvdIm_SS_vs_Logan_071513-320x180.jpg" style="margin: 5px; padding: 0px; border: none; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;" width="320" /></a>\r\n	<p class="wp-caption-text" style="margin: 0px 0px 4px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">\r\n		Silver Samurai previs.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, ''Lucida Grande'', ''Gill Sans'', Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 21px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">\r\n	Halon took the plates of video footage filmed by David Leitch&rsquo;s stunt team and edited and &lsquo;postvis&rsquo;d&rsquo; over the top, which would then serve the second unit and stunt teams during principal photography. Mocap was also relied on early on to flesh out various fight stunt scenes. &ldquo;Fox has a MVN suit from Xsens,&rdquo; notes Reagan, &ldquo;so we went down to David Leitch&rsquo;s stages and they did mocap of some of our scenes that had been blocked out with boards. Then we did some mocap for some martial arts movements.

Boston had a second consecutive All-Star Game MVP in 1955 as Bill Sharman scored 10 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter of the East&#39;s 100-91 win over the West in the second NBA All-Star Game played at Madison Square Garden.

He received the top prize of &pound;80,000.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Sheffield based Ding, age 26, took his first ranking title on home soil since the 2005 China Open in Beijing. He has often struggled to handle the weight of expectation when he plays in China, but he produced some excellent snooker this week, not least in the final which saw him compile a century and seven more breaks over 50.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	That 2005 Ding victory was the catalyst for the explosion of interest in snooker in China. Since then, increasing numbers of Chinese players have earned places on the professional tour. Prior to this week, only Liang Wenbo had come close to emulating Ding&#39;s success, reaching one ranking final and briefly climbing into the top 16.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Now, Xiao looks the leading candidate to be the &#39;next best&#39; player from mainland China. He is one of the most improved players on the circuit over the past two years and played some superb snooker this week to reach his first ranking final. The 24-year-old Gloucester-based cueman can enjoy his biggest pay-day, &pound;35,000, and look ahead with confidence to the rest of the season.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Ding took the first two frames today with top breaks of 42 and 83, then Xiao made 62 and 67 for 2-2. Ding regained the lead with a 66 before Xiao came from 46-0 down in the sixth to make it 3-3. Ding pulled away at the end of the first session, knocking in 126 and 58 for 5-3 then taking the last frame of the session on the colours.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	On the resumption, Xiao pulled one back with a 78, only for Ding to reel off three frames in a row with 58, 78 and 81 for 9-4. Xiao threatened a fight back as he dominated the next two for 9-6, and led 45-0 in frame 16. But Ding then took his chance with a smooth 71 to seal the title.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&quot;Before the final I knew I needed to build an early lead, and I had to keep my safety strong to force my opponent to give me chances,&quot; said Ding. &quot;I built a three-frame-lead in the afternoon session because Xiao&#39;s safety was not as good as mine. But he managed to play relaxed and open frames in the evening so he did pull some frames back, after I had reached nine. I&#39;m just happy that I managed to win my tenth frame with a solid break.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&quot;Liang Wenbo has been in the final of this tournament too so hopefully there will be many more chances for the players from China. The young generation is growing up quickly so their days will come soon.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&quot;I had to let my emotions go after winning the tournament. This showed how much I wanted this title, I wanted it more than anybody. But there was less pressure on me than in the past when I played here in China.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&quot;I&#39;ve been changing my game a little bit with a friend&#39;s help, and training a lot. Now I can concentrate more on my snooker and this win means a lot to my career.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Xiao said: &quot;Today is a historic day, no matter whether I won or not. Two Chinese players performing a top class match on worldwide stage. I&#39;m so proud of myself, being a Chinese player. I&#39;ve always dreamed of winning a title but I wasn&#39;t very comfortable out there because this is my first ranking final. I&#39;ll be more relaxed next time.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&quot;It&#39;s a special experience for me. I hope not to disappear from sight and hopefully I will take part in many more world class tournaments.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&quot;Before this match my goal was to get into the top 32. I&#39;m in the top 32 now but I hope to raise my ranking steadily. It seems to be really hard for me to get into top 16 this season, but if I keep my form it&#39;s not impossible. I played well in the first few tournaments this season so hopefully I can achieve my goal.&quot;</p>\r\n');

In 1998, the most recent contest in New York, Michael Jordan garnered MVP honors as he scored 23 points and added eight assists and six rebounds during a 135-114 victory for the East.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tNBA All-Star competitions will get underway on Friday, Feb. 13, as the league&#39;s top rookies and second-year players take the court in the BBVA Rising Stars Challenge. Saturday&#39;s festivities will feature State Farm All-Star Saturday Night, an all-inclusive skills showcase comprised of Sears Shooting Stars, a competition featuring NBA and WNBA players, and NBA legends; Taco Bell Skills Challenge, a contest of top guards working against the clock to complete a series of passes, free throws, layups and agility drills; Foot Locker Three-Point Contest, a longstanding staple of the evening; and the high-flying Sprite Slam Dunk. Sunday&#39;s slate of activities will also feature a Sprint Pregame Concert before the 64th NBA All-Star Game tips off.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tThe NBA will continue to demonstrate its commitment to social responsibility during NBA All-Star 2015 with a full schedule of NBA Cares events. NBA Cares will partner with schools, government and local nonprofit organizations in New York and surrounding areas to highlight the league&#39;s grassroots and community initiatives that reach millions of young people and their parents, while providing critical resources to community-based programs.<\\/p>\\r\\n","source":"Pi","pages":"1","user_update":"1","seo_title":"","seo_keywords":"","seo_description":"","slug":"","related":[]}', 1, 1, 7, 'upload/article/feature/2013/09/26/5243d6e28b2c1.jpg', 1380177623, 1380177624, 1380177649, 1, 1380177683, ''),

He received the top prize of &pound;80,000.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tSheffield based Ding, age 26, took his first ranking title on home soil since the 2005 China Open in Beijing. He has often struggled to handle the weight of expectation when he plays in China, but he produced some excellent snooker this week, not least in the final which saw him compile a century and seven more breaks over 50.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tThat 2005 Ding victory was the catalyst for the explosion of interest in snooker in China. Since then, increasing numbers of Chinese players have earned places on the professional tour. Prior to this week, only Liang Wenbo had come close to emulating Ding&#39;s success, reaching one ranking final and briefly climbing into the top 16.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tNow, Xiao looks the leading candidate to be the &#39;next best&#39; player from mainland China. He is one of the most improved players on the circuit over the past two years and played some superb snooker this week to reach his first ranking final. The 24-year-old Gloucester-based cueman can enjoy his biggest pay-day, &pound;35,000, and look ahead with confidence to the rest of the season.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tDing took the first two frames today with top breaks of 42 and 83, then Xiao made 62 and 67 for 2-2. Ding regained the lead with a 66 before Xiao came from 46-0 down in the sixth to make it 3-3. Ding pulled away at the end of the first session, knocking in 126 and 58 for 5-3 then taking the last frame of the session on the colours.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tOn the resumption, Xiao pulled one back with a 78, only for Ding to reel off three frames in a row with 58, 78 and 81 for 9-4. Xiao threatened a fight back as he dominated the next two for 9-6, and led 45-0 in frame 16. But Ding then took his chance with a smooth 71 to seal the title.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t&quot;Before the final I knew I needed to build an early lead, and I had to keep my safety strong to force my opponent to give me chances,&quot; said Ding. &quot;I built a three-frame-lead in the afternoon session because Xiao&#39;s safety was not as good as mine. But he managed to play relaxed and open frames in the evening so he did pull some frames back, after I had reached nine. I&#39;m just happy that I managed to win my tenth frame with a solid break.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t&quot;Liang Wenbo has been in the final of this tournament too so hopefully there will be many more chances for the players from China. The young generation is growing up quickly so their days will come soon.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t&quot;I had to let my emotions go after winning the tournament. This showed how much I wanted this title, I wanted it more than anybody. But there was less pressure on me than in the past when I played here in China.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t&quot;I&#39;ve been changing my game a little bit with a friend&#39;s help, and training a lot. Now I can concentrate more on my snooker and this win means a lot to my career.&quot;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tXiao said: &quot;Today is a historic day, no matter whether I won or not. Two Chinese players performing a top class match on worldwide stage. I&#39;m so proud of myself, being a Chinese player. I&#39;ve always dreamed of winning a title but I wasn&#39;t very comfortable out there because this is my first ranking final. I&#39;ll be more relaxed next time.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t&quot;It&#39;s a special experience for me. I hope not to disappear from sight and hopefully I will take part in many more world class tournaments.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t&quot;Before this match my goal was to get into the top 32. I&#39;m in the top 32 now but I hope to raise my ranking steadily. It seems to be really hard for me to get into top 16 this season, but if I keep my form it&#39;s not impossible. I played well in the first few tournaments this season so hopefully I can achieve my goal.&quot;<\\/p>\\r\\n","source":"Pi","pages":"1","user_update":"0","seo_title":"","seo_keywords":"","seo_description":"","slug":"","related":[]}', 1, 2, 24, '', 1380179968, 1380179969, 0, 1, 1380180408, '');

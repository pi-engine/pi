# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, in reverse chronological order by release.

## 1.2.0 - 2019-01-22

### Added

- [#6](https://github.com/zendframework/zendxml/pull/6) adds the following method:
 
  ```php
  Security::scanHtml(
      string $html,
      DOMDocument $dom = null,
      int $libXmlConstants = 0
  ) : SimpleXMLElement|DOMDocument|bool
  ```
  
  This method allows scanning markup known to be HTML, versus assuming the
  markup is generic XML.

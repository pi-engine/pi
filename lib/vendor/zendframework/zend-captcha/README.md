`Zend\Captcha` component is able to manage “Completely Automated Public Turing
test to tell Computers and Humans Apart” (CAPTCHA); it is used as a challenge-response
to ensure that the individual submitting information is a human and not an
automated process. Typically, a captcha is used with form submissions where
authenticated users are not necessary, but you want to prevent spam submissions.

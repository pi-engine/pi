# Introduction to Zend\\Barcode

## Overview

`Zend\Barcode\Barcode` provides a generic way to generate barcodes. The `Zend\Barcode` component is
divided into two subcomponents: barcode objects and renderers. Objects allow you to create barcodes
independently of the renderer. Renderer allow you to draw barcodes based on the support required.

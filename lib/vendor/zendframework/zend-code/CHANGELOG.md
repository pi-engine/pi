# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, in reverse chronological order by release.

## 2.5.3 - 2015-11-18

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- [#10](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-code/pull/10) removes a
  development dependency on zendframework/zend-version.
- [#23](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-code/pull/23) removes a
  requirement on zendframework/zend-stdlib. This results in a slight change in
  `Zend\Code\Generator\ValueGenerator`: `setConstants()` and `getConstants()`
  can now receive/emit *either* an SPL `ArrayObject` or
  `Zend\Stdlib\ArrayObject`. Since these are functionally equivalent, however,
  you will experience no change in behavior.

### Fixed

- Nothing.
